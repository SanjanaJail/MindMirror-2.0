# MindMirror 2.0
Audio-Based Deep Learning System for Longitudinal Mental Health Trajectory Analysis

## Problem Statement
Mental health conditions such as stress, anxiety, and depression often remain undetected due to lack of continuous, non-invasive monitoring. Existing assessments rely heavily on self-reporting, which may fail to capture early warning signs.

MindMirror 2.0 explores **vocal biomarkers** as objective signals to analyze and track mental health patterns over time using deep learning techniques.

## What This Project Does
- Processes speech audio to extract meaningful vocal features
- Trains deep learning models for mental health state classification
- Analyzes longitudinal trends for early risk detection
- Generates interpretable insights for preventive mental healthcare

## Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow, Librosa, NumPy, Pandas, Flask

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into modular components for preprocessing, feature extraction, modeling, training, and evaluation.

## Sample Results
Sample evaluation metrics and plots are provided in the `results/` directory.

## Status
This project is under active development as part of research in human-centered AI and mental health analytics.
